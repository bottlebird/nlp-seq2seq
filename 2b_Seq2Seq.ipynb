writeup**\n","\n","Your lab report should discuss any implementation details that were important to filling out the code above. Then, use the code to set up experiments that answer the following questions:\n","\n","1. In this lab we use greedy search for decoding, that is, always taking the most probable word at current timestep as prediction. Describe an alternative decoding method that might work better than greedy search. You don't have to implement it.\n","\n","2. Pick some samples from dev or test set and visualize their attention maps. Discuss your findings. Hint: compute the attention scores on the input words for each timestep during decoding.\n","\n","3. Compare the performance of seq2seq with and without attention on sentences of different lengths. You can set some length intervals (e.g., 1-10, 11-20, 21-30, 31-40, 41-50) and compare the two models' performance within each length interval. Discuss your findings.\n","\n","4. Try to improve your BLEU score. For example, try stacking more RNN layers, switching cell types, or applying bi-direction to encoder. Describe what you try, even if they don't show improvement. Hints:\n","  * TA's preliminary implemtation of seq2seq with attention model achieves around 16. You don't have to surpass it (although it's pretty simple to do so)--this number is just to give you some sense of what a baseline should get.\n","  * Training on the entire training set takes some time. So tune your hyperparameters on a smaller training set (you can do so by changing `sampling` when creating the data loader)."]}]}
