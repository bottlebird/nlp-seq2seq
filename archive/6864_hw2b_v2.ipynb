In this lab we use greedy search for decoding, that is, always taking the most probable word at current timestep as prediction. Describe an alternative decoding method that might work better than greedy search. You don't have to implement it.\n","\n","2.

Compare the performance of seq2seq with and without attention on sentences of different lengths.

Try to improve your BLEU score. For example, try stacking more RNN layers, switching cell types, or applying bi-direction to encoder. Describe what you try, even if they don't show improvement. Hints:\n","  * TA's preliminary implemtation of seq2seq with attention model achieves around 16. You don't have to surpass it (although it's pretty simple to do so)--this number is just to give you some sense of what a baseline should get.\n","  * Training on the entire training set takes some time. So tune your hyperparameters on a smaller training set (you can do so by changing `sampling` when creating the data loader)."]}]}
